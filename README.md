# Nostd Structs (and Algorithms)

The purpose of this crate is to provide datastructures and algorithms that are useful in environments without std.
This goes for embedded devices, no OS environments, WebAssembly, and code where you prefer stack allocation over heap.

The algorithms and datastructures themselves will be wide-ranging and fairly esoteric, but nontheless applicable.

This is project really created as a central place for community contributions.
I will be working on this myself for the time being, but the intention is that this becomes quite bigger than it currently is.
